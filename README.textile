h1. That is my personal page at gighub.

Welcome to My personal page at gighub. 

It was my first planned way on using HTML and CSS.

h2. My other goals with this page are:

* Tell you a bit more about me: MarcRic
* Improve my skills on github (my first "real" project here")
* Provide another page template at github (free to use and improve)
* Just HTML and CSS, nothing else (I think I'm Zen with this)

h2. Extra Information

* "This work is totally under the WTF Public License: ":http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
